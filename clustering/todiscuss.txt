kprf is very slow atm because of direct implementation, need to find a way to make it faster
    --> Fix triple nested loop
PRF testing is not easy with black box algos since we don't get which centroids are associated with which agents 
    --> Should I just associate each agent with the closest centroid? If so, it might be pretty slow to calc this manually O(pqr), where p = number of agents, q = dimension, r = number of centroids.
    --> Doesn't require information of algorithms, only requires their results. But have to think of a fast way of computation.
Not sure with how to deal with categorial variables in datasets (e.g --> bank.csv) (Should I just map integers to each thing?)
    --> just map categories to a set of integers.
    --> Scale down numerical variables in order to not skew the data

Note: for testing, we want to test like: n_centroids = 5,10,50,200 etc.


Done since last week:

Optimised a1 slightly --> runs in one less polynomial multiple time: should run on the wholesale dataset in < 1 hour, maybe less depending on number of clusters
    Couldn't find an exact constant to fix floating point error in python 
        --> floating point error makes it so that the reduction of total weights by n/k is overdone, so we don't select enough centroids eventually 
        --> Not sure what is a good value to set here
    --> Need to make this faster somehow
        --> Slow because of line 233: Have to check - for every c, for every i for every d_j in worst case 
        --> i is in (1,3 * 10^5), so c is in (1,3*10^5), j upto 9*10^10 
        --> So total comparisons is 81 * 10^20 --> 8 * 10^21
    --> Not sure how to make this faster 
    --> One option is to run this on smaller datasets, but doesn't accomplish the goal as well 

Fixed categorical variable input for bank data 


TODO:
Optimisation: Use smaller datasets (ok)
Rouding error: Maybe round down each n/k to nearest 0.001 etc (done)

Find MSE of each point from nearest centroid for kprf, k++ and compare (Do this first)
Do something for PRF on k++

TODO:

DO MSE for 3-4 datasets and a few ks, and get MSD for each to make some graphics.

Show some graphs by next week

Find some examples where PRF is violated by other 2 algorithms.
