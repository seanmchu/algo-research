Write up algo 3 from the new paper for the case N=M (done)
Test all 3 algorithms for K means criterion against the small datasets (DONE)



Fix algo 3 use existing distances instead of incrementing delta by one each time 
Write up some PRF check.


TODO:

DO MSE for 3-4 datasets and a few ks, and get MSD for each to make some graphics.

Show some graphs by next week

Find some examples where PRF is violated by other 2 algorithms.


New TODO:

Add new distance measures as per Barton's requests 
Rerun all tests 
Plot
